      <h4>In the book <i>Heroes</i>, by Robert Cormier, Francis Joseph Cassavant is returning from <br>
              WWII with the challenge of having part of his face blown off by a grenade. As Francis struggles<br>
              to come to terms with his new identity, he becomes increasingly isolated and distant from the <br>
              people around him. He feels like he no longer belongs in his hometown, and is unable to connect <br>
              with his friends in the same way that he did before the war. The book highlights the struggles <br>
              that some veterans face when returning home from war.

            Larry is very charming and clever, and he uses these skills to convince the people of Frenchtown to follow him. <br>
            However, he is not really a good person and causes harm and destruction wherever he goes. Francis,
            initially idolizes Larry,<br>
            but eventually realizes that Larry is not the hero he<br> thought he was and must confront him as his enemy.</h4>

              I would recomend the book <i>Heroes</i> to anyone who likes books about WWI or WWII<br>
              because it talks about what happened after the war and what it was like for veterans.
